I have made sure that the pages are compatible with different browsers and devices, as I have also worked on optimizing their performance to improve the user experience. In this same portfolio there are projects for companies and personal projects that demonstrate my skills.<br /><br />Regarding the backend, I have used technologies such as Node.js, Express and MySQL, in order to create REST APIs. I have also worked on the integration of different systems and platforms so that applications can interact with other services.<br /><br />In summary, my experience in web page development has allowed me to acquire both frontend and backend skills, which has allowed me to fully understand how web applications work and how they can be improved to offer a better user experience. user.`,
